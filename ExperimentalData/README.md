# Experimental Log/Notes (written) for Experimental Data collected
This file contains commentary and notes on the data collected within the
`ExperimentalData` folder of this repository.

## July 21, 2022
First collection of open loop data for the treatment of TEOS wafers. 31 samples
were treated, with 28 containing valid data. Treatment parameters for the data
collection are listed in [this Excel sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11XSvAFbMtYl3doMqZjAGY9qEgc7f4dpo/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=106042046026168166788&rtpof=true&sd=true).

The first folder (2022_07_21_14h07m28s) of the data collection for this day was
to test and ensure the data collection code was working with the setup.

The second folder (2022_07_21_14h17m03s-Sample1-test) was a trial run of the
parameters listed for the first sample. This sample was doubly-treated to fix a
bug in the data collection code.

The remainder of the folders contain valid experimental results for the samples
listed from 1-28. There are two folders for Sample 15. The first
(2022_07_21_14h36m40s-Sample15) may be discarded since the sample was dropped
after treatment.
